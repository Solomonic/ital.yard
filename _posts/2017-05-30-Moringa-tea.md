## How to use it

Sofar I&I used fresh (1-3 days after the cut) leaves and stems and added them into veggie soup and pasta sauce. The taste is first mostly onionish-spicy, with a very soft bitter aftertaste. I&I could accustom to this immediatly and liked it right away.

I&I read about people unable to stand the strong bitterness, which is quite opposite to I&I experience. After tasting and testing for several days I&I recognized that the bitterness of the leaves increased overtime. I&I believe bitter moringa is just not fresh enough to be enjoyable to consume.

To conservate the rest of the herb. I&I dececided to make ...

### Homemade tea
I&I took leaves and stems (5 days after the cut), gave them a good round in the blender and used my electic oven to dry the mix on low temperature for 2h.

 The Tea is now already perfectly fine to brew, for storage purpose it needed 3 more days out in the open to dry up, this will hugely vary with the local humitity.

 I&I brew it up 3times and get a nice the golden color and herbal-minty taste, which I&I enjoy first thing in the morning. Since Rastaman nutrition is already irie, I&I felt no overwhelming effects but it wakes me up without coffaine.
