## Let's grow it
Since we want to sustain our daily food from the own garden, Moringa seems to be a perfect candidate to enrich our diet. According to I&Is research it should grow perfectly on ItalYard, with its sandy soils. Wikipedia mentions _Moringa species grow quickly in many types of environments._ which sounds awesome for a farmerman, low effort & hardiness combined with a big yield? ...Sounds too good so lets test it ... 

### First Try: Mai 2017
I&I got 17 wild Moringa Seedlings and put them into earth at the beginning of the rain season 2017. It was free and wasn't grown for commercial purpose.
