## How to use it

### Homemade tea
![Hang them]({{site.baseurl}}/images/moringa/hanged_up.jpg)

I&I took fresh leaves and stems, gave them a good round in the blender and used my electic oven to dry the mix on low temperature for 2h.

 The Tea is now already perfectly fine to brew, for storage purpose it needed 3 more days out in the open to dry up, this will hugely vary with the local humitity.

## Lets grow it
Since we want to sustain our daily food from the own garden, Moringa seems to be a perfect candidate to enrich our diet. According to I&Is research it should grow perfectly on ItalYard, with its sandy soils. Wikipedia mentions _Moringa species grow quickly in many types of environments._ which sounds awesome for a farmerman, low effort & hardiness combined with a big yield? ...Sounds too good so lets test it ... 

### First Try: Mai 2017
I&I got 17 wild Moringa Seedlings and put them into earth at the beginning of the rain season 2017. It was free and wasn't grown for commercial purpose.
